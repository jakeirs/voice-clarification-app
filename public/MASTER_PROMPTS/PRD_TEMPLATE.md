Excellent feedback. Tailoring the template to be mobile-first and adding a low-fidelity wireframing component makes it even more powerful for a solo creator. It allows for rapid visualization without leaving the document.

Here is the revised, mobile-first PRD template.

## [Feature Name] - Product Requirements Document (Mobile-First)

---

### **1. The Big Picture: Why & What**

> _**Purpose:** This section is the 'True North'. It defines the feature's soul. It's what you read when you get lost in the details, to remind yourself of the core problem you're solving and for whom._

**1.1. The Narrative & User Goal**

*   **User's Mindset & Goal:** When a user arrives here, what are they trying to achieve? What is their emotional state (e.g., focused, creative, frustrated, curious)?
*   **The Story of this Screen:** In one paragraph, tell the story of this feature. How does it welcome the user, guide them, and help them achieve their goal on their mobile device?

**1.2. Core Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** What is the single most important thing a user must accomplish here? What business goal does this support? _(e.g., "Increase user engagement by making it simple to create a new project.")_
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a `[user type]`, I want to `[action]` so that `[benefit]`.
    *   As a `[user type]`, I want to `[action]` so that `[benefit]`.

### **2. The Experience: Look, Feel & Flow**

> _**Purpose:** This is the bridge from 'why' to 'how'. It describes the intangible experience and the user's journey, focusing on emotion, hierarchy, and interaction before defining specific components._

**2.1. Visual & Interactive Blueprint**

*   **First Impression (The "5-Second Test"):** What does the user see and feel on their phone screen in the first 5 seconds? What is the hero element? What's the overall aesthetic? _(e.g., "Clean and minimalist with a single, bold call-to-action," "A feed that feels native and endlessly scrollable")._
*   **Information Hierarchy:** Describe the visual flow on a vertical screen. What should the user's eye be drawn to first, second, and third? Explain the reasoning.
*   **Interaction Model:** What is the primary way the user interacts with this screen? _(e.g., "Interaction is centered around vertical scrolling and tapping, with key actions accessible in a bottom tab bar or a floating action button.")_

**2.2. The User Journey Map**

*   **The Ideal Flow (Happy Path):** Walk through the perfect user journey step-by-step, from entry to successful exit.
    1.  User opens the screen.
    2.  User sees `[Element A]` at the top.
    3.  User taps on `[Button B]`.
    4.  ...and achieves their goal, seeing a `[Success Toast/Snackbar]`.
*   **Moments of Delight:** Where can we inject small, delightful micro-interactions, animations, or haptic feedback? _(e.g., "When the user pulls to refresh, a custom animated logo appears. Upon successful form submission, the device gives a short, satisfying vibration.")_
*   **Handling Friction (Graceful Failure):** How do we handle moments when the user is lost, makes a mistake, or has no connection? What is the tone? _(e.g., "The empty state isn't a dead end; it's an encouraging starting point with clear guidance. Offline state is communicated via a subtle banner at the top.")_

### **3. The Blueprint: Layout & Components**

> _**Purpose:** This is the detailed architectural plan. It breaks down the screen into tangible, buildable pieces. For each piece, we define not just what it is, but its role and personality._

**3.1. Screen Layout & ASCII Wireframe**

*   **Layout Description:** _(e.g., "A single-column, scrollable view with a fixed header at the top and a floating action button (FAB) in the bottom-right corner.")_

*   **Low-Fidelity Wireframe:**
    ```
    +----------------------------------------+
    | [<- Back]  Page Title       [Icon]   |  <-- Fixed Header
    +----------------------------------------+
    |                                        |
    |  +----------------------------------+  |
    |  | Card Title                       |  |
    |  | Description text goes here...    |  |
    |  +----------------------------------+  |
    |                                        |
    |  +----------------------------------+  |  <-- Main scrollable content
    |  | Card Title                       |  |
    |  | Description text goes here...    |  |
    |  +----------------------------------+  |
    |                                        |
    |                ...                     |
    |                                        |
    |                                     (+)|  <-- Floating Action Button (FAB)
    +----------------------------------------+
    | [Tab 1]  [Tab 2]  [Tab 3]  [Tab 4]    |  <-- Optional Bottom Tab Bar
    +----------------------------------------+
    ```

**3.2. Key Components & Their "Personalities"**

*   **Component A (e.g., 'The Project Card'):**
    *   **What it is:** A tappable container displaying summary information for a project.
    *   **Its Personality:** "This is a digestible snapshot. It should feel clean and provide just enough information to be useful without being cluttered. The entire card is a button, inviting the user to dive deeper."
*   **Component B (e.g., 'The Floating Action Button'):**
    *   **What it is:** The primary 'create' action, always accessible.
    *   **Its Personality:** "This is the spark of creation. It's bright, optimistic, and sits above the content, always ready. Tapping it should feel responsive and launch a smooth transition to the creation screen."

### **4. The Logic: Interactions & States**

> _**Purpose:** This section gets technical. It's the playbook for development, defining exactly how the components behave under all mobile-centric conditions._

**4.1. Step-by-Step Interaction Logic (When... Then...)**

*   **On Screen Load:** The screen shows a skeleton loader. The page title is set to "[Feature Name]".
*   **When** a user taps the **Floating Action Button**, **then** the 'Create New' screen slides up from the bottom.
*   **When** a user taps and holds a **'Project Card'**, **then** a context menu appears with 'Edit' and 'Delete' options.
*   **When** a user pulls down from the top of the list, **then** a refresh indicator appears and data is re-fetched.

**4.2. States & Edge Cases**

*   **Loading State:** _(e.g., "Content-specific skeleton loaders that mimic the final card layout will be used.")_
*   **Empty State:** _(e.g., "Display an illustration, a headline like 'Create your first project,' and a primary button to guide the user.")_
*   **Error State:** _(e.g., "If data fetch fails, a full-page error component is shown with a 'Try Again' button. For form validation, display inline error messages below the relevant fields.")_

**4.3. Mobile Interaction States Checklist (Example: A Button Card)**

```markdown
- **Default:** How the element looks before any interaction.
- **Selected/Active:** How the element looks when it is the current, active choice (e.g., a selected tab).
- **Disabled:** How the element looks when it is not interactive (e.g., greyed out with reduced opacity).
```

### **5. Definition of Done: Scope & Validation**

> _**Purpose:** This section sets the finish line. It defines the boundaries of the project and provides a clear, testable checklist to confirm when the work is truly complete._

**5.1. Scope & Limitations**

*   **IN SCOPE FOR V1:**
    *   [List the core functionalities that MUST be included].
    *   Responsive layout for mobile and tablet portrait views.
*   **OUT OF SCOPE (Future Enhancements):**
    *   [List related ideas that will NOT be built now to prevent scope creep].
    *   e.g., Landscape view optimizations, desktop-specific layout, offline mode.

**5.2. Acceptance Criteria (Given-When-Then)**

*   **Given** I am a logged-in user, **when** I open the app to the Dashboard and have no projects, **then** I must see the empty state view.
*   **Given** I am on the Dashboard, **when** I tap the FAB, **then** the 'Create Project' screen must animate into view.
*   **Given** the 'Create Project' screen is open, **when** I enter an invalid name and tap 'Save', **then** I must see an inline error message and the form must not submit.

**5.3. Brain Dump & Open Questions**

> _A low-pressure zone for raw ideas, technical notes, and questions to resolve._

*   *Question:* Should we use native haptics on form success? -> **Decision:** Yes, it adds a premium feel.
*   *Idea for V2:* Use swipe-to-reveal actions on the list items instead of tap-and-hold.
*   *Potential Issue:* The initial data load might be large. Consider pagination or infinite scroll from the start to ensure good performance.
